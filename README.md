# quotes-api

I built an api for the first time.<br>
use postman to send requests.<br>
index.js should run locally<br><br>

Requests:<br>
get random quote<br>
get quote by id<br>
get quote by type(Success,Life,Friendship ...)<br>
post a quote with the following parameters (text,author,type)(Since database is not used to store the posted quotes, they will be gone when you restart the server)<br>
put,patch,delete a quote by id.
